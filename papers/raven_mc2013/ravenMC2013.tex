%  This is a sample LaTeX input file for your contribution to 
%  the MC2013 conference. Modified by R.C. Martineau at INL from A. 
%  Sood at LANL, from J. Wagner ORNL who obtained the original class 
%  file by Jim Warsa, LANL, 16 July 2002}
%
%  Please use it as a template for your full paper 
%    Accompanying/related file(s) include: 
%       1. Document class/format file: mc2013.cls
%       2. Sample Postscript Figure:   figure.eps
%       3. A PDF file showing the desired appearance: template.pdf 
%    Direct questions about these files to: richard.martinea@inl.gov
%
%    Notes: 
%      (1) You can use the "dvips" utility to convert .dvi 
%          files to PostScript.  Then, use either Acrobat 
%          Distiller or "ps2pdf" to convert to PDF format. 
%      (2) Different versions of LaTeX have been observed to 
%          shift the page down, causing improper margins.
%          If this occurs, adjust the "topmargin" value in the
%          mc2013.cls file to achieve the proper margins.
