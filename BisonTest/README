I run this example problem nightly.  The run takes approximately half
an hour using 12 cpus.

I would vary:
Power:                +/- 5%
Clad Young's modulus: +/- 2%
Initial grain radius: range 5-10e-6

I can suggest others if needed.

I would monitor the von Mises stress in the cladding.  Choose an
element somewhere near the mid-height of the fuel stack.
