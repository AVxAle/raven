validation metrics - mathematical operators that compute the difference between the experimentally measured results and the simulation results.  V\&V in SC, pg 469 (See also page 473)

type 1 error: model builder's risk.  The error of rejecting the model when the model is actually correct (such as because of comparison with incorrect data) V\&V in SC, pg 481

type 2 error: model user's risk.  The error of accepting validity of the model when the model is actually invalid.  V\&V in SC, pg 482


Comparison of mean values.  V\&V in SC, pg 485.  $L_1$ or $L_2$ vector norms usually used:

\begin{equation}
  \| S - E \|_p = \left(\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1} | S(x_i) - E(x_i)|^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}
\end{equation}

Comparison of mean with experimental mean and variance. V\&V in SC, pg
493-497.  The goal is to determine the true error based on $\tilde{E}
= y_m - \bar{y}_e$ where $y_m$ is the computed value, $\bar{y}_e$ is
the experimental mean and $\tilde{E}$ is the estimated error.  The
experimental mean is:

\begin{equation}
  \bar{y}_e = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} y^i_e
\end{equation}

The sample standard deviations is:

\begin{equation}
  s = \left[ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum^n_{i=1} (y^i_e - \bar{y}_e)^2 \right ]^\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

The interval containing the true error $E = y_m - \mu$ where the level of confidence is $100(1-\alpha)$\% is:

\begin{equation}
  \left ( \tilde{E}-t_{\alpha/2,v}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\tilde{E}+t_{\alpha/2,v}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}  \right )
\end{equation}

Comparison of means using interpolation of experimental data. V\&V in
SC, pg 500-501.  If there are multiple sets of experimental data that
relate input variables to results, then the interpolation of the sets
can be used for statistics.  The standard deviation can be calculated
as (where the sets of interpolated experimental data are $y^i_e(x)$):

\begin{equation}
  s(x) \sim \left [ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum^n_{i=1}\left ( y^i_e(x) - \bar{y}_e(x) \right ) ^2 \right ] ^\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

The true error is in the interval:

\begin{equation}
  \left ( \tilde{E}(x)-t_{\alpha/2,v}\cdot\frac{s(x)}{\sqrt{n}},\tilde{E}(x)+t_{\alpha/2,v}\cdot\frac{s(x)}{\sqrt{n}}  \right )
\end{equation}

I think this may not be very useful because of the number of
assumptions required and the shear amount of data that is required to
get enough $y^i_e$ values.
