validation metrics - mathematical operators that compute the difference between the experimentally measured results and the simulation results.  V\&V in SC, pg 469 (See also page 473)

type 1 error: model builder's risk.  The error of rejecting the model when the model is actually correct (such as because of comparison with incorrect data) V\&V in SC, pg 481

type 2 error: model user's risk.  The error of accepting validity of the model when the model is actually invalid.  V\&V in SC, pg 482


Comparison of mean values.  V\&V in SC, pg 485.  $L_1$ or $L_2$ vector norms usually used:

\begin{equation}
  \| S - E \|_p = \left(\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1} | S(x_i) - E(x_i)|^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}
\end{equation}
