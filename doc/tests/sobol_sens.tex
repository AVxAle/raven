\section{Global Sobol Sensitivity 1}
Associated external model: \texttt{sudret\_sobol\_poly.py}

This model provides analytic Sobol sensitivities for a flexible number of input parameters.  It is taken from
\ref{sudret} and has the following form:
\begin{equation}
  u(Y) = \frac{1}{2^N} \prod_{n=1}^N \left(3y_n^2 + 1).
\end{equation}
The variables $y_n$ are distributed uniformly on [0,1].  For five input variables ($N=5$), the Sobol sensitivities are
as follows, to 12 digits of accuracy:
\begin{align}
  S_1 = S_2 = S_3 &= \frac{25}{91} (0.2747), \\
  S_{1,2} = S_{1,3} = S_{2,3} &= \frac{5}{91} (0.0549), \\
  S_{1,2,3} &= \frac{1}{91} (0.0110).
\end{align}
The mean is 1.0 and the variance is 0.72*.
