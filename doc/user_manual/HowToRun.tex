\section{Running RAVEN}

% I don't think this is mentioned earlier?
%As already mentioned, 
The RAVEN code is a mixture of C++, C, and Python software. The entry point 
resides on the Python side and is accessible via a command line interface.
%
After following the instructions in the previous Section, RAVEN is ready to be
used. 
%
The RAVEN driver is contained in the folder ``\texttt{raven/framework}.''
%
To run RAVEN, open a terminal and use the following command (replace \texttt{<inputFileName.xml>} with your RAVEN input file):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
python raven/framework/Driver.py <inputFileName.xml>
\end{lstlisting}
