\section{Installation Overview}

The installation of the RAVEN code is a straightforward procedure;
depending on the usage purpose and machine architecture, the
installation process slightly differs.

In the following sections, all the different installation procedures
are reported.

There are two main requirements to installing RAVEN, installing the
RAVEN dependencies (Section \ref{raven_dependencies}) and installing
RAVEN itself (Section \ref{raven_installation}).  For any particular
installation, only one of the raven dependency procedures and one of
the raven installation paths needs to be taken.

For OSX it is recommended that the dependencies be installed with
Miniconda (Section \ref{miniconda}).  For Linux, it is recommended
that the distribution package manager be used if possible (Section
\ref{sysprep_linux}).

There are several different ways of getting RAVEN as described in
Section \ref{raven_installation}.  They vary depending on how easy
they are to use and how easy they are to develop with (these tend to
be inversely correlated).

\section{RAVEN Dependencies Installation}
\label{raven_dependencies}

RAVEN is built upon several freely available open-source software packages, 
which must  be installed before it will function properly:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |}
    \hline Package & Purpose \\
    \hline git & Source code control tool \\
    \hline g++ & C++ language compiler suite (Needed to build
        support code in the RAVEN package) \\
    \hline libtool & Generic library management tool \\
    \hline python & Scripting language RAVEN is written in \\
    \hline swig & Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator 
        (Used to create Python interfaces to supporting C++ code) \\
    \hline hdf5 & Library providing interface to HDF5 database 
        file format used by RAVEN \\
    \hline h5py & Python interface to HDF5 database library \\
    \hline numpy & N-Dimensional array package for Python \\
    \hline scipy &  Scientific computing package for Python \\
    \hline scikit-learn & Machine learning library for Python \\
    \hline matplotlib & Plotting library for Python \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}


RAVEN is supported on three separate computing platforms:
Linux, OSX (Apple Macintosh), and Microsoft Windows.  Depending
on which of these systems is used, the preparation of the system 
to run RAVEN varies.

\subsection{Preparing a Linux System for RAVEN}
\label{sysprep_linux}

When installing RAVEN on a Linux system, it is recommended that the
distribution's package manager be used to install the dependencies.
Doing so automates the process and automatically includes any needed
dependencies of the requested packages.  Below are instructions for 
doing so for two popular Linux distributions, Ubuntu and Fedora.

\subsubsection{Ubuntu}

The Ubuntu distribution of Linux makes use of the Advanced Package Tool 
(APT) to automate the installation of preconfigured software.  The following
command uses the APT to add the needed packages and any needed 
dependencies not already on the system:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install libtool git python-dev swig g++ \
  python3-dev python-numpy python-sklearn python-h5py
\end{lstlisting}

Optionally, if you want to be able to edit and rebuild the manual, you can
install \TeX~Live and its related packages:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-extra-utils \
  texlive-latex-extra texlive-math-extra
\end{lstlisting}

\goToRavenInstallation

\subsubsection{Fedora}

When using the Fedora Linux distribution, use the RPM package manager to 
install needed dependencies:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
dnf install swig libtool gcc-c++ redhat-rpm-config python-devel \
  python3-devel numpy h5py scipy python-scikit-learn \
  python-matplotlib-qt4
\end{lstlisting}

In addition, if you would like to be able to build the documentation 
included in the RAVEN software distribution it is necessary to install 
\TeX~Live and its related packages:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
dnf install texlive texlive-subfigure texlive-stmaryrd \
  texlive-titlesec texlive-preprint texlive-placeins \
  texlive-bigints texlive-relsize texlive-appendix
\end{lstlisting}

Note: The 'dnf' command replaces 'yum' used on older versions of
Fedora Linux.

\subsection{Preparing an Apple Macintosh OSX System for RAVEN}
\label{sysprep_osx}

When using an Apple Macintosh computer, the above dependencies are met
by following three steps: Installing the XCode command line tools from Apple, 
installing the XQuartz  X-Window system server, and then installing and using the Miniconda
package system to add the rest of the dependencies.

\subsubsection{Installing XCode Command Line Tools}

The XCode command line tools package from Apple Computer provides the C++ 
compilers and git source code control tools needed to obtain and build RAVEN.
It is freely available from the Apple developer site (download and install the appropriate link 
for your version of OSX):
\begin{itemize}
    \item For El Capitan download and install: \url{https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode}
    \item For Yosemite download and install:  \url{https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode%20-}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Installing XQuartz}
XQuartz is an implementation of the X Server for the Mac OSX operating system.  It is required 
becuase RAVEN is often used with applications developed with the Multiphysics 
Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Download and install: \url{https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.9.dmg}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Installing Miniconda and Packages}
\label{miniconda}

For OSX, the simplest and most robust way to install the RAVEN dependencies
is to install and use Miniconda to obtain them (see \url{http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html} for more information).

To install Miniconda, download and install the appropriate file from \url{http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html}.

After Miniconda has been installed, it may then be used to install the rest of the packages needed to run RAVEN:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
conda install numpy hdf5 h5py scipy scikit-learn matplotlib swig
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Preparing a Windows System for RAVEN}
\label{sysprep_windows}

Since RAVEN requires a UNIX-like shell to function, one must be installed for a Microsoft
Windows system to run it.  A freely available software package called MSYS2 is used to
provide this functionality.  More information about MSYS2 is available at 
\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20introduction/}.

\subsubsection{Prerequisites to use RAVEN on Windows}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A system running a 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows. Installation and operation 
        has been verified on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard. While there 
        is also a 32-bit version of MSYS2 available, the RAVEN installation described here will not work with it.
    \item At least 7 Gigabytes of available disk space:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3.5 GB for MSYS2, including everything necessary to build and run RAVEN: Python, GNU compilers, required Python packages, git
        \item 1.5 GB for RAVEN and Crow
        \item 1.1 GB for the MOOSE framework, upon which RAVEN is based
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Installation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain and run the latest basic 64-bit MSYS2 installer from \url{ https://msys2.github.io/} (As of this writing it is named
	msys2-x86\_64-20160205.exe and is approximately 50 Megabytes in size).  
    \item The page with the download also contains installation instructions. Perform the steps described there up to 
	step 4 to install a minimal MSYS2 system. Make sure that you install to path C:\textbackslash{}msys64. There 
	is no need to go past step 4 because the balance of what is needed to run RAVEN under MSYS2 have been 
	pre-packaged together in one large archive file. 
    \item Download the pre-built archive file containing MSYS2 packages needed to run RAVEN.  A link to the current version of
	this file may be found in the Windows installation section of the RAVEN Wiki: 
	\url{https://hpcgitlab.inl.gov/idaholab/raven/wikis/installationWindows#obtain-and-install-the-pre-built-archive-containing-msys2-packages-needed-for-raven}
    \item Use a Windows archive file program such as WinZip to open the large zip file just downloaded.  Shut down any 
	MSYS2 shells you have open and then copy the "msys64" folder from the large zip file so that it is copied right 
	on top of the MSYS2 installation performed above. When the file copying is done (which will take a while) 
	you should have an environment ready to receive RAVEN.
    \item This installation will create shortcuts that may be used to start UNIX-Like shells:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item MSYS2 Shell
	    \item MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell
	    \item MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell
	\end{itemize}
	For best results with Python, a copy of the shortcut pointing to  "MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell" needs to be created. Give
	it a name like " MinGW-w64 Win64 SH".  Open the properties of this new shortcut an add "-sh" to the end of the Target
	field.  Use this new shortcut to start shells that will be used to run RAVEN.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{For More Information}
Note: An illustrated version of this procedure may be found on the Wiki page at 
\url{https://hpcgitlab.inl.gov/idaholab/raven/wikis/installationWindows}.

\subsection{Manual Dependency Install}
\label{sysprep_manual}

If other options don't work, the dependencies can be installed
manually.  This is sometimes tricky, pay attention to the order you
install them.  RAVEN uses the following packages (newer versions
usually work):

\begin{enumerate}
  \input{libraries.tex}
\item hdf5-1.8.12
\item Cython-0.18
\item swig-2.0.12
\end{enumerate}

\section{RAVEN Installation}
\label{raven_installation}

Once the RAVEN dependencies have been installed (See Section
\ref{raven_dependencies}), the rest of RAVEN can be installed.

There are several different ways to get RAVEN.  There are trade offs
between how easy it is to setup and how easy it is to develop with the
method.  If you are using several MOOSE applications and want to share
the MOOSE directory go to Section \ref{parallel_directory_git}.  If
you want to do development on RAVEN and RAVEN is the only MOOSE
application you are using or you don't mind having duplicate MOOSE
directories, go to Section \ref{submodule_git}.  If you don't need to
do RAVEN development but want to keep up with the latest version of
RAVEN, the RAVEN Whole repository can be used as described in Section
\ref{raven_whole_devel}.  If you don't need to do RAVEN development,
and want to track a stable version of RAVEN, the RAVEN Whole
repository with a stable branch can be used as described in Section
\ref{raven_whole_stable}.  If git is not used, the Source Code
Package in Section \ref{raven_source_package} can be used.

\subsection{Parallel Directory Git}
\label{parallel_directory_git}

This install method uses git to obtain the software, and the raven,
crow, and moose directories are installed at the same level.  This is
used to allow other MOOSE applications to share the same MOOSE and
libmesh.

First follow the MOOSE getting started instructions:  \url{http://mooseframework.org/getting-started/}

This is generally:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose.git
cd  moose/scripts
./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh
cd ../../
\end{lstlisting}

Next Crow and RAVEN need to be cloned:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/crow.git
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/raven.git
\end{lstlisting}

If RELAP-7 will be used, only IAPWS should be initialized instead of
all the submodules:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/relap-7.git
cd relap-7
git submodule update --init contrib/iapws
cd ..
\end{lstlisting}

Next the RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd raven
make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

If RELAP-7 is used, the rest of raven can be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#make sure you are in the raven directory
make
\end{lstlisting}


Then the testing should be done.  If RELAP-7 is not used the framework
tests should be run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

If RELAP-7 is used, all the tests can be run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./run_tests
\end{lstlisting}


The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.

If all the tests pass, you are ready to read about Running RAVEN in
Section \ref{HowToRun}.

To update the software, the git pull command can be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd moose
git pull
#Possibly libmesh needs to be rebuilt at this point.
cd ../crow
git pull
cd ../raven
git pull
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Submodule Git}
\label{submodule_git}

This install method uses git to obtain the software and uses
submodules to get Crow and MOOSE.  This can be used for RAVEN and Crow
development.

First RAVEN needs to be cloned, and then the submodules initialized.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:idaholab/raven.git
cd raven
git submodule update --init crow moose
\end{lstlisting}

Next follow the compilation and testing instructions in Section \ref{raven_compilation}.

To update the software, the git pull and submodule update commands can
be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git pull
git submodule update
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{RAVEN Whole Devel Branch}
\label{raven_whole_devel}

This install method uses git to get a custom repository that includes
only the parts of Crow and MOOSE that are needed by RAVEN.  This
repository is updated every time RAVEN or Crow or MOOSE are changed
and the RAVEN framework tests pass.

First clone the RAVEN whole repository:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:cogljj/raven.git
cd raven
\end{lstlisting}

Next follow the compilation and testing instructions in Section \ref{raven_compilation}.

To update the software, the git pull command can be used:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git pull
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{RAVEN Whole Stable Branch}
\label{raven_whole_stable}

This is the same as in the previous Section \ref{raven_whole_devel},
but after the clone command a stable branch is checked out:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone git@hpcgitlab.inl.gov:cogljj/raven.git
cd raven
git checkout stable/2015_july
\end{lstlisting}

The rest is the same as the RAVEN Whole devel branch.  The stable
branches are updated less frequently, and input changes that would
invalidate existing files are not allowed.

The compilation and testing instructions in Section
\ref{raven_compilation} can be followed.

\subsection{RAVEN Source Code Package}
\label{raven_source_package}

Untar the source install (if there is more than one version of the
source tarball, the full filename will need to be used instead of *):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
tar -xvzf raven_framework_*_source.tar.gz
cd raven
\end{lstlisting}

Next follow the compilation and testing instructions in Section
\ref{raven_compilation}.

\subsection{RAVEN Compilation}
\label{raven_compilation}

The RAVEN modules should be compiled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#change into the raven directory if needed.
make framework_modules
\end{lstlisting}

Then the testing should be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./run_framework_tests
\end{lstlisting}

The output should describe why any tests failed.

At the end, there should be a line that looks similar to the output below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
8 passed, 19 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
\end{lstlisting}

Normally there are skipped tests because either some of the codes are
not available, or some of the test are not currently working.  The
output will explain why each is skipped.

If all the tests pass, you are ready to read about Running RAVEN in
Section \ref{HowToRun}.

If the tests did not pass, check Section
\ref{troubleshooting_installation} on troubleshooting.

\subsection{Troubleshooting the Installation}
\label{troubleshooting_installation}

Often the problems result from one or more of the libraries being
incorrect or missing.  In the raven directory, the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./run_tests --library_report
\end{lstlisting}
can be used to check if all the libraries are available, and which
ones are being used.  If amsc, distribution1D or interpolationND are
missing, then the RAVEN modules need to be compiled or recompiled.
Otherwise, the RAVEN dependencies need to be fixed.

\subsection{In-use Testing}

In use testing can be done by re-running the installation tests as
described in Section \ref{raven_compilation}.
