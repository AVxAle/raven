General information of how the program is queried
\begin{itemize}
%\item [Simulation:] First and last lines of the input file, the whole input file must be written between these two lines
%\item [RunInfo:] General information of how the program is queried
\item  \textbf{WorkingDir}: the path to the directory where the output files are going to be located (starting from the same directory where the input file was located)
\item \textbf{ParallelCommand*}: the command that should be used to submit jobs in parallel
\item \textbf{quequingSoftware*?}: quequing software name
\item \textbf{ThreadingCommand*}: The command should be used to submit multi-threaded jobs?????
\item \textbf{NumThreads*}: number of threads by run
\item \textbf{NumNode*}: number of nodes used in the HPC 
\item \textbf{procByNode*}: number of processors used in a single node 
\item \textbf{NumCoresUsed*}: total number of cores used
\item \textbf{NumMPI*}: number of MPI processes by run
\item \textbf{MaxLogFileSize*} :**********
\item \textbf{precommand}: add before of the command that is used to run the external model
\item \textbf{postcommand}: add after of the command that is used to run the external model
\item \textbf{deleteOutExtension}:if a run of an external model has not failed delete the outut files with the listed extension
\item \textbf{delSucLogFiles}:if a run of an external model has not failed delete the log files with the listed extension
\item \textbf{Files}: these are the paths to the files required by the code, string from the working directory 
\item \textbf{Sequence}: ordered list of the step name that the simulation will run
\item \textbf{mode}: these refers to the way in which the parallel environment is set up (currently the only modes supported are pbsdsh and mpi).
\item \textbf{batchSize}: number of contemporaneous runs, 
\item \textbf{expectedTime*}: how much time the simulation is expected to run
\item \textbf{DefaultInputFile}: default input file to be read*******
\item \textbf{CustomMode}: **********

The example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<RunInfo>
    <WorkingDir>externalModel</WorkingDir>
    <Files>lorentzAttractor.py</Files>
    <Sequence>MonteCarlo</Sequence>
    <batchSize>100</batchSize>
    <NumThreads>4</NumThreads>    
    <mode>mpi</mode>
    <NumMPI>2</NumMPI>
</RunInfo>
\end{lstlisting}
Specifies the working directory (WorkingDir) where are located the files necessary (Files) to run a series of 100 (batchSize) Monte-Carlo calculations (Sequence).
MPI (mode) mode is used along with 4 threads (NumThreads) and 2 mpi process per run (NumMPI).
