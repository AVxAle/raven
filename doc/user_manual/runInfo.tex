\section{RunInfo  \\ \vspace{2 mm} {\small Author: xxx x. xxx}}

The section RunInfo contains the following information:
\begin{description}
\item [DefaultInputFile:] default input file to use
\item [SimulationFiles:] the xml input file
\item [ScriptDir:] the location of the pbs script interfaces
\item [FrameworkDir:] the directory where the framework is located
\item [WorkingDir:] the directory where the framework should be running
\item [TempWorkingDir:] the temporary directory where a simulation step is run
\item [NumMPI:] the number of mpi process by run
\item [NumThreads:] Number of Threads by run
\item [numProcByRun:] the total number of core used by one run (number of threads by number of mpi)
\item [batchSize:] number of contemporaneous runs
\item [ParallelCommand:] the command that should be used to submit jobs in parallel (mpi)
\item [ThreadingCommand:] the command should be used to submit multi-threaded  
\item [numNode:] number of nodes
\item [procByNode:] number of processors by node
\item [totalNumCoresUsed:] total number of cores used by driver 
\item [quequingSoftware:] quequing software name
\item [stepName:] the name of the step currently running
\item [precommand:] add to the front of the command that is run
\item [postcommand:] added after the command that is run.
\item [delSucLogFiles:] if a simulation (code run) has not failed, delete the relative log file (if True)
\item [deleteOutExtension:] if a simulation (code run) has not failed, delete the relative output files with the listed extension (comma separated list, for example: 'e,r,txt')
\item [mode:] running mode: currently the only modes supported are pbsdsh and mpi
\item [expectedTime:] how long the complete input is expected to run.

The example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<RunInfo>
    <WorkingDir>externalModel</WorkingDir>
    <Files>lorentzAttractor.py</Files>
    <Sequence>MonteCarlo</Sequence>
    <batchSize>100</batchSize>
    <NumThreads>4</NumThreads>    
    <mode>mpi</mode>
    <NumMPI>2</NumMPI>
</RunInfo>
\end{lstlisting}
specifies the working directory (WorkingDir) where are located the files necessary (Files) to run a series of 10 (batchSize) Monte-Carlo calculations (Sequence).
MPI (mode) mode is used along with 4 threads (NumThreads) and 2 mpi process per run (NumMPI).
