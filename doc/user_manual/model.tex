    coefficients.

    closed-form solution.
    %
    \item `sparse\_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in
    scipy.sparse.linalg.cg.

    As an iterative algorithm, this solver is more appropriate than
    `cholesky' for large-scale data (possibility to set tol and max\_iter).

    scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr.
    %
    It is the fatest but may not be available in old scipy versions.

    It also uses an iterative procedure.

In RAVEN, \textbf{Models} are crucial entities.
%
A model is an object that employs a mathematical representation of a
phenomenon, either of a physical or other nature (e.g. statistical operators,
etc.).
%
From a practical point of view, it can be seen, as a ``black box'' that, given
an input, returns an output.
%

RAVEN has a strict classification of the different types of models.
%
Each ``class'' of models is represented by the definition reported above, but it
can be further classified based on its particular functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{Code} represents an external system code that employs a high
  fidelity physical model.
  \item \xmlNode{Dummy} acts as ``transfer'' tool.
  %
  The only action it performs is transferring the the information in the input
  space (inputs) into the output space (outputs).
  %
  For example, it can be used to check the effect of a sampling strategy, since
  its outputs are the sampled parameters' values (input space) and a counter
  that keeps track of the number of times an evaluation has been requested.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{ROM}, or reduced order model, is a mathematical model trained
  to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
  %
  Typically, ROMs trade speed for accuracy representing a faster, rough estimate
  of the underlying phenomenon.
  %
  The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
  model with respect to variation of its parameters subject to probabilistic
  behavior.
  %
  The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into
  the algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those
  results.
  \item \xmlNode{ExternalModel}, as its name suggests, is an entity existing 
  outside the RAVEN framework that is embedded in the RAVEN code at run time.
  %
  This object allows the user to create a Python module that will be treated as
  a predefined internal model object.
%\item [Projector:] generic data manipulator
  \item \xmlNode{PostProcessor} is a container of all the actions that can
  manipulate and process a data object in order to extract key information,
  such as statistical quantities, clustering, etc.
  %
\end{itemize}
Before analyzing each model in detail, it is important to mention that each
type needs to be contained in the main XML node \xmlNode{Models}, as reported
below:

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]

    <WhatEverModel name='whatever'>
      ...

\end{lstlisting}
In the following sub-sections each \textbf{Model} type is fully analyzed and
described.

\subsection{Code}
\label{subsec:models_code}
As already mentioned, the \textbf{Code} model represents an external system
software employing a high fidelity physical model.
%
The link between RAVEN and the driven code is performed at run-time, through
coded interfaces that are the responsible for transferring information from the
code to RAVEN and vice versa.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:existingInterface}, all of the available interfaces are
reported and, for advanced users, Section~\ref{sec:newCodeCoupling} explains how
to couple a new code.

  %
  In the body of this node the user specifies the name of the variable that
  RAVEN will look for in the output files of the code.

\label{subsec:models_dummy}
The \textbf{Dummy} model is an object that acts as a pass-through tool.
%
The only action it performs is transferring the information in the input
space (inputs) to the output space (outputs).
%
For example, it can be used to check the effect of a particular sampling
strategy, since its outputs are the sampled parameters' values (input space) and
a counter that keeps track of the number of times an evaluation has been
requested.

%%%%% ROM Model  %%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ROM}
\label{subsec:models_ROM}
A Reduced Order Model (ROM) is a mathematical model consisting of a fast
solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system.
%
The ``training'' process is performed by sampling the response of a physical
model with respect to variations of its parameters subject, for example, to
probabilistic behavior.
%
The results (outcomes of the physical model) of the sampling are fed into the
algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of ROMs, both internally developed and
imported through an external library called ``scikit-learn''~\cite{SciKitLearn}.

Currently in RAVEN, the ROMs are classified into 4 sub-types that, once chosen,

\end{itemize}

The types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes depend on the sub-type
specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.
%
In the sections that follow, the specifications of each type are reported.
%
%%%%% ROM Model - NDspline  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{NDspline}
\label{subsubsec:NDspline}
The NDspline sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an $N$-dimensional
spline interpolation/extrapolation scheme.
%
In spline interpolation, the interpolant is a special type of piecewise
polynomial called a spline.
%
The interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials
for the spline.
%
Spline interpolation avoids the problem of Runge's phenomenon, in which
oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using higher degree
polynomials.
%

In order to use this ROM, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute \xmlAttr{subType} needs to
be \xmlString{NDspline} (see the example below).
%
No further XML sub-nodes are required.
%
\nb This ROM type must be trained from a regular Cartesian grid.
%
Thus, it can only be trained from the outcomes of a grid sampling strategy.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={name,subType}]

</Simulation>
\end{lstlisting}
%%%%% ROM Model - NDinvDistWeigth  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{NDinvDistWeigth}
\label{subsubsec:NDinvDistWeigth}
The NDinvDistWeigth sub-type contains a single ROM type, based on an
$N$-dimensional inverse distance weighting formulation.
%
Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for
multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points.
%
The assigned values to unknown points are calculated via a weighted average of
the values available at the known points.
%

In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be xmlString{NDinvDistWeigth} (see the example 
below).
%
\subnodeIntro

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{p}, \xmlDesc{integer, required field}, must be greater than
  zero and represents the ``power parameter''.
  %
  For the choice of value for \xmlNode{p},it is necessary to consider the degree
  of smoothing desired in the interpolation/extrapolation, the density and
  distribution of samples being interpolated, and the maximum distance over
  which an individual sample is allowed to influence the surrounding ones (lower
  $p$ means greater importance for points far away).
  %
\end{itemize}

%%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn  %%%%%%%
\subsubsection{SciKitLearn}
\label{subsubsec:SciKitLearn}
The SciKitLearn sub-type represents the container of several ROMs available in
RAVEN through the external library scikit-learn~\cite{SciKitLearn}.
%

In order to use this Reduced Order Model, the \xmlNode{ROM} attribute
\xmlAttr{subType} needs to be \\ \xmlString{SciKitLearn} (i.e. 
\xmlAttr{subType}\textbf{\texttt{=}}\xmlString{SciKitLearn}).
%
The specifications of a \xmlString{SciKitLearn} ROM depend on the value assumed
by the following sub-node within the main \xmlNode{ROM} XML node:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{SKLtype}, \xmlDesc{vertical bar (\texttt{|}) separated string,
  required field}, contains a string that represents the ROM type to be used.
  %
  As mentioned, its format is:\\
  \xmlNode{SKLtype}\texttt{mainSKLclass|algorithm}\xmlNode{/SKLtype} where the
  first word (before the ``\texttt{|}'' symbol) represents the main class of
  algorithms, and the second word (after the ``\texttt{|}'' symbol) represents
  the specific algorithm.
  %
\end{itemize}
Based on the \xmlNode{SKLtype} several different algorithms are available.
%
In the following paragraphs a brief explanation and the input requirements are
reported for each of them.
%
%%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Linear Models %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Linear Models}
\label{LinearModels}
The LinearModels' algorithms implement generalized linear models.
%
They include Ridge regression, Bayesian regression, lasso, and elastic net
estimators computed with least angle regression and coordinate descent.
%
This class also implements stochastic gradient descent related algorithms.
%
In the following, all of the linear models available in RAVEN are reported.
%
\subparagraph{Linear Model: Automatic Relevance Determination Regression}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Automatic Relevance Determination} (ARD) regressor is a
hierarchical Bayesian approach where hyperparameters explicitly represent the
relevance of different input features.
%
These relevance hyperparameters determine the range of variation for the
parameters relating to a particular input, usually by modelling the width of a
zero-mean Gaussian prior on those parameters.
%
If the width of the Gaussian is zero, then those parameters are constrained to
be zero, and the corresponding input cannot have any effect on the predictions,
therefore making it irrelevant.
%
ARD optimizes these hyperparameters to discover which inputs are relevant.

\subparagraph{Linear Model: Bayesian ridge regression}
\mbox{}

The \textit{Bayesian ridge regression} estimates a probabilistic model of the
regression problem as described above.
%
The prior for the parameter $w$ is given by a spherical Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
p(w|\lambda) =\mathcal{N}(w|0,\lambda^{-1}\bold{I_{p}})
\end{equation}
The priors over $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are chosen to be gamma distributions, the
conjugate prior for the precision of the Gaussian.
%
The resulting model is called Bayesian ridge regression, and is similar to the
classical ridge regression.
%
The parameters $w$, $\alpha$, and $\lambda$ are estimated jointly during the fit
of the model.
%
The remaining hyperparameters are the parameters of the gamma priors over
$\alpha$ and $\lambda$.
%
These are usually chosen to be non-informative.
%
The parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal log likelihood.

\subparagraph{Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.) with SGD

\mbox{}

The \textit{Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.) with SGD
training} implements regularized linear models with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated for each sample at
a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength
schedule (aka learning rate).
%
SGD allows minibatch (online/out-of-core) learning, see the partial\_fit method.
%
This implementation works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays of
floating point values for the features.
%
The model it fits can be controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits
a linear support vector machine (SVM).
%
The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared Euclidean norm L2 or
the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net).
%
If the parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieves
online feature selection.

%%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Support Vector Machines %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Support Vector Machines}
\label{SVM}
In machine learning, \textbf{Support Vector Machines} (SVMs, also support vector
networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms
that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression
analysis.
%
Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two
categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples
into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear
classifier.
%
An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so
that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is
as wide as possible.
%
New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a
category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
%
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a
non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly
mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
%
In the following, all the SVM models available in RAVEN are reported.

\subparagraph{Linear Support Vector Classifier}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Linear Support Vector Classifier} is similar to SVC with parameter
kernel=`linear', but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm,
so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and
should scale better (to large numbers of samples).
%
This class supports both dense and sparse input and the multiclass support is
handled according to a one-vs-the-rest scheme.

  loss.

  %
  \item \xmlNode{penalty}, \xmlDesc{string, `l1' or `l2'}, specifies the norm
  used in the penalization.
  %
  The `l2' penalty is the standard used in SVC.
  %
  The `l1' leads to coef\_vectors that are sparse.

  consistent, it is seldom used in practice and rarely leads to better accuracy

  %

  weight.
  \nb The synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization as are all
  other features.

\paragraph{Multi Class}
\label{Multiclass}
Multiclass classification means a classification task with more than two
classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples,
or pears.
%
Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to
one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at
the same time.
%
In the following, all the multi-class models available in RAVEN are reported.

\subparagraph{One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass/multilabel strategy}
\mbox{}

The \textit{One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass/multilabel strategy}, also known
as one-vs-all, consists in fitting one classifier per class.
%
For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes.
%
In addition to its computational efficiency (only n\_classes classifiers are
needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability.
%
Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible
to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier.
%
This is the most commonly used strategy and is a fair default choice.

At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected.
%
Since it requires to fit n\_classes * (n\_classes - 1) / 2 classifiers, this
method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n\_classes\^2)
complexity.
%
However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel
algorithms which do not scale well with n\_samples.
%
This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of
the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used n\_classes
times.

%
At fitting time, one binary classifier per bit in the code book is fitted.
%
At prediction time, the classifiers are used to project new points in the class
space and the class closest to the points is chosen.
%
The main advantage of these strategies is that the number of classifiers used
can be controlled by the user, either for compressing the model ($0 < code_size
< 1$) or for making the model more robust to errors ($code_size > 1$).

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: naiveBayes %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Naive Bayes}
\label{naiveBayes}
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on
applying Bayes' theorem with the ``naive'' assumption of independence between
every pair of features.
%
Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x\_1 through x\_n,
Bayes' theorem states the following relationship:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) P(x_1, \dots x_n \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Using the naive independence assumption that
\begin{equation}
P(x_i | y, x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_n) = P(x_i | y),
\end{equation}
for all i, this relationship is simplified to
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)}
{P(x_1, \dots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
Since $P(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is constant given the input, we can use the following
classification rule:
\begin{equation}
P(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_n) \propto P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y)
\Downarrow
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg\max_y P(y) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \mid y),
\end{equation}
and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate $P(y)$ and
$P(x_i \mid y)$; the former is then the relative frequency of class $y$ in the
training set.
%
The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make
regarding the distribution of $P(x_i \mid y)$.

In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes
classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously
document classification and spam filtering.
%
They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary
parameters.
%
(For theoretical reasons why naive Bayes works well, and on which types of data
it does, see the references below.)
Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more
sophisticated methods.
%
The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each
distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution.
%
This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of
dimensionality.

On the flip side, although naive Bayes is known as a decent classifier, it is
known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict\_proba are
not to be taken too seriously.
%
In the following, all the Naive Bayes available in RAVEN are reported.
%
%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Gaussian Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy} implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes
algorithm for classification.
%
The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_y}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x_i -
  \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma^2_y}\right)
\end{equation}
The parameters $\sigma_y$ and $\mu_y$ are estimated using maximum likelihood.

In order to use the \textit{Gaussian Naive Bayes strategy}, the user needs to
set the sub-node:

\xmlNode{SKLtype}\texttt{naiveBayes|GaussianNB}\xmlNode{/SKLtype}.

There are no additional sub-nodes available for this method.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{Multinomial Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Multinomial Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes algorithm for
multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes
variants used in text classification (where the data is typically represented
as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in
practice).
%
The distribution is parametrized by vectors $\theta_y =
(\theta_{y1},\ldots,\theta_{yn})$ for each class $y$, where $n$ is the number of
features (in text classification, the size of the vocabulary) and $\theta_{yi}$
is the probability $P(x_i \mid y)$ of feature $i$ appearing in a sample
belonging to class $y$.
%
The parameters $\theta_y$ are estimated by a smoothed version of maximum
likelihood, i.e. relative frequency counting:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta}_{yi} = \frac{ N_{yi} + \alpha}{N_y + \alpha n}
\end{equation}
where $N_{yi} = \sum_{x \in T} x_i$ is the number of times feature $i$ appears
in a sample of class y in the training set T, and
$N_{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{|T|} N_{yi}$ is the total count of all features for class
$y$.
%
The smoothing priors $\alpha \ge 0$ account for features not present in the
learning samples and prevents zero probabilities in further computations.
%
Setting $\alpha = 1$ is called Laplace smoothing, while $\alpha < 1$ is called
Lidstone smoothing.

\subparagraph{Bernoulli Naive Bayes}
\mbox{}
\\The \textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} implements the naive Bayes training and
classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate
Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is
assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable.
%
Therefore, this class requires samples to be represented as binary-valued
feature vectors; if handed any other kind of data, a \textit{Bernoulli Naive
Bayes} instance may binarize its input (depending on the binarize parameter).
%
The decision rule for Bernoulli naive Bayes is based on
\begin{equation}
P(x_i \mid y) = P(i \mid y) x_i + (1 - P(i \mid y)) (1 - x_i)
\end{equation}
which differs from multinomial NB's rule in that it explicitly penalizes the
non-occurrence of a feature $i$ that is an indicator for class $y$, where the
multinomial variant would simply ignore a non-occurring feature.
%
In the case of text classification, word occurrence vectors (rather than word
count vectors) may be used to train and use this classifier.
%
\textit{Bernoulli Naive Bayes} might perform better on some datasets, especially
those with shorter documents.
%
It is advisable to evaluate both models, if time permits.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Neighbors %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Neighbors}
\label{Neighbors}

The \textit{Neighbors} class provides functionality for unsupervised and
supervised neighbor-based learning methods.
%
The unsupervised nearest neighbors method is the foundation of many other
learning methods, notably manifold learning and spectral clustering.
%
Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors: classification for
data with discrete labels, and regression for data with continuous labels.

The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of
training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label
from these.
%
The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor
learning), or vary based on the local density of points (radius-based neighbor
learning).
%
The distance can, in general, be any metric measure: standard Euclidean distance
is the most common choice.
%
Neighbor-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods,
since they simply ``remember'' all of its training data (possibly transformed
into a fast indexing structure such as a Ball Tree or KD Tree.).

In the following, all the Neighbors' models available in RAVEN are reported.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Tree %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Tree}
\label{tree}

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
classification and regression.
%
The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some advantages of decision trees are:
  \item Simple to understand and to interpret.
  %
  Trees can be visualized.
  %
  \item Requires little data preparation.
  %
  Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be
  created and blank values to be removed.
  %
  Note however, that this module does not support missing values.
  %
  \item The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the
  number of data points used to train the tree.
  %
  \item Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
  %
  Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only
  one type of variable.
  %
  \item Able to handle multi-output problems.
  %
  \item Uses a white box model.
  %
  If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the
  condition is easily explained by boolean logic.
  %
  By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network),
  results may be more difficult to interpret.
  %
  \item Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.
  %
  That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
  %
  \item Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true
  model from which the data were generated.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of decision trees include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not
  generalise the data well.
  %
  This is called overfitting.
  %
  Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum
  number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the
  tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
  %
  \item Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data
  might result in a completely different tree being generated.
  %
  This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
  %
  \item The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be
  NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts.
  %
  Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on
  heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal
  decisions are made at each node.
  %
  Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree.
  %
  This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where
  the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.
  %
  \item There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not
  express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.
  %
  \item Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.
  %
  It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the
  decision tree.
  %

In the following, all the linear models available in RAVEN are reported.

 %%%%% ROM Model - SciKitLearn: Gaussian Process %%%%%%%
\paragraph{Gaussian Process}
\label{GP}
Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) is a generic supervised learning
method primarily designed to solve regression problems.
%
The advantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prediction interpolates the observations (at least for regular
  correlation models).
  \item The prediction is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that one can compute
  empirical confidence intervals and exceedance probabilities that might be used
  to refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region of
  interest.
  \item Versatile: different linear regression models and correlation models can
  be specified.
  %
  Common models are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom models
  provided they are stationary.
  %
\end{itemize}
The disadvantages of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is not sparse.
  %
  It uses the whole samples/features information to perform the prediction.
  \item It loses efficiency in high dimensional spaces – namely when the
  number of features exceeds a few dozens.
  %
  It might indeed give poor performance and it loses computational efficiency.
  \item Classification is only a post-processing, meaning that one first needs
  to solve a regression problem by providing the complete scalar float precision
  output $y$ of the experiment one is attempting to model.
  %
\end{itemize}

\skltype{Gaussian Process Regressor}{GaussianProcess|GaussianProcess}

\begin{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%  External  Model   %%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{External Model}
\label{subsec:models_externalModel}
As the name suggests, an external model is an entity that is embedded in the
RAVEN code at run time.
%
This object allows the user to create a python module that is going to be
treated as a predefined internal model object.
%
In other words, the \textbf{External Model} is going to be treated by RAVEN as a
normal external Code (e.g. it is going to be called in order to compute an
arbitrary quantity based on arbitrary input).
%

The specifications of an External Model must be defined within the XML block
\xmlNode{ExternalModel}.
%
This XML node needs to contain the attributes:

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined name
  of this External Model.
  %
  \nb As with the other objects, this is the name that can be used to refer to
  this specific entity from other input blocks in the XML.
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, must be kept
  empty.
  \item \xmlAttr{ModuleToLoad}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, file name
  with its absolute or relative path.
  %
  \nb If a relative path is specified, it must be relative with respect to where
  the user runs the code.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

In order to make the RAVEN code aware of the variables the user is going to
manipulate/use in her/his own python Module, the variables need to be specified
in the \xmlNode{ExternalModel} input block.
%
The user needs to input, within this block, only the variables that RAVEN needs
to be aware of (i.e. the variables are going to directly be used by the code)
and not the local variables that the user does not want to, for example, store
in a RAVEN internal object.
%
These variables are specified within consecutive \xmlNode{variable} blocks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{variable}, \xmlDesc{string, required parameter}.
  %
  In the body of this XML node, the user needs to specify the name of the
  variable.
  %
  This variable needs to match a variable used/defined in the external python
  model.
  %
\end{itemize}

When the external function variables are defined, at run time, RAVEN initializes
them and tracks their values during the simulation.
%
Each variable defined in the \xmlNode{ExternalModel} block is available in the
module (each method implemented) as a python ``self.''
%

In the External Python module, the user can implement all the methods that are
needed for the functionality of the model, but only the following methods, if
present, are called by the framework:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{\textbf{def \_readMoreXML}}, \xmlDesc{OPTIONAL METHOD}, can be
  implemented by the user if the XML input that belongs to this External Model
  needs to be extended to contain other information.
  %
  The information read needs to be stored in ``self'' in order to be available
  to all the other methods (e.g. if the user needs to add a couple of newer XML
  nodes with information needed by the algorithm implemented in the ``run''
  method).
  \item \texttt{\textbf{def initialize}}, \xmlDesc{OPTIONAL METHOD}, can
  implement all the actions need to be performed at the initialization stage.
  \item \texttt{\textbf{def createNewInput}}, \xmlDesc{OPTIONAL METHOD}, creates
  a new input with the information coming from the RAVEN framework.
  %
  In this function the user can retrieve the information coming from the RAVEN
  framework, during the employment of a calculation flow, and use them to
  construct a new input that is going to be transferred to the ``run'' method.
  \item \texttt{\textbf{def run}}, \xmlDesc{REQUIRED METHOD}, is the actual
  location where the user needs to implement the model action (e.g. resolution
  of a set of equations, etc.).
  %
  This function is going to receive the Input (or Inputs) generated either by
  the External Model ``createNewInput'' method or the internal RAVEN one.
\end{itemize}

In the following sub-sections, all the methods are going to be analyzed in
detail.

\subsubsection{Method: \texttt{def \_readMoreXML}}
\label{subsubsec:externalReadMoreXML}
As already mentioned, the \textbf{readMoreXML} method can be implemented by the
user if the XML input that belongs to this External Model needs to be extended
to contain other information.
%
The information read needs to be stored in ``self'' in order to be available to
all the other methods (e.g. if the user needs to add a couple of newer XML nodes
with information needed by the algorithm implemented in the ``run'' method).
%
If this method is implemented in the \textbf{External Model}, RAVEN is going to
call it when the node \xmlNode{ExternalModel} is found parsing the XML input
file.
%
The method receives from RAVEN an attribute of type ``xml.etree.ElementTree'',
containing all the sub-nodes and attribute of the XML block \xmlNode{ExternalModel}.
%

Example XML:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={subType,ModuleToLoad}]
<Simulation>
  ...
  <Models>
     ...
    <ExternalModel name='AnExtModule' subType='' ModuleToLoad='path_to_external_module'>
       <variable>sigma</variable>
       <variable>rho</variable>
       <variable>outcome</variable>
       <!--
          here we define other XML nodes RAVEN does not read automatically.
          We need to implement, in the external module ``AnExtModule'' the readMoreXML method
        -->
        <newNodeWeNeedToRead>
            whatNeedsToBeRead
        </newNodeWeNeedToRead>
    </ExternalModel>
     ...
  </Models>
  ...
</Simulation>
\end{lstlisting}

Corresponding Python function:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def _readMoreXML(self,xmlNode):
  # the xmlNode is passed in by RAVEN framework
  # <newNodeWeNeedToRead> is unknown (in the RAVEN framework)
  # we have to read it on our own
  # get the node
  ourNode = xmlNode.find(``newNodeWeNeedToRead'')
  # get the information in the node
  self.ourNewVariable = ourNode.text
  # end function
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Method: \texttt{def initialize}}
\label{subsubsec:externalInitialize}
The \textbf{initialize} method can be implemented in the \textbf{External Model}
in order to initialize some variables needed by it.
%
For example, it can be used to compute a quantity needed by the ``run'' method
before performing the actual calculation).
%
If this method is implemented in the \textbf{External Model}, RAVEN is going to
call it at the initialization stage of each ``Step'' (see section
\ref{sec:steps}.
%
RAVEN will communicate, thorough a set of method attributes, all the information
that are generally needed to perform a initialization:
\begin{itemize}
  \item runInfo, a dictionary containing information regarding how the
  calculation is set up (e.g. number of processors, etc.).
  %
  It contains the following attributes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{DefaultInputFile} -- default input file to use
    \item \texttt{SimulationFiles} -- the xml input file
    \item \texttt{ScriptDir} -- the location of the pbs script interfaces
    \item \texttt{FrameworkDir} -- the directory where the framework is located
    \item \texttt{WorkingDir} -- the directory where the framework should be
    running
    \item \texttt{TempWorkingDir} -- the temporary directory where a simulation
    step is run
    \item \texttt{NumMPI} -- the number of mpi process by run
    \item \texttt{NumThreads} -- number of threads by run
    \item \texttt{numProcByRun} -- total number of core used by one run (number 
    of threads by number of mpi)
    \item \texttt{batchSize} -- number of contemporaneous runs
    \item \texttt{ParallelCommand} -- the command that should be used to submit
    jobs in parallel (mpi)
    \item \texttt{numNode} -- number of nodes
    \item \texttt{procByNode} -- number of processors by node
    \item \texttt{totalNumCoresUsed} -- total number of cores used by driver
    \item \texttt{queueingSoftware} -- queueing software name
    \item \texttt{stepName} -- the name of the step currently running
    \item \texttt{precommand} -- added to the front of the command that is run
    \item \texttt{postcommand} -- added after the command that is run
    \item \texttt{delSucLogFiles} -- if a simulation (code run) has not failed,
    delete the relative log file (if True)
    \item \texttt{deleteOutExtension} -- if a simulation (code run) has not
    failed, delete the relative output files with the listed extension (comma
    separated list, for example: `e,r,txt')
    \item \texttt{mode} -- running mode, curently the only modes supported are
    pbsdsh and mpi
    \item \textit{expectedTime} -- how long the complete input is expected to
    run
    \item \textit{logfileBuffer} -- logfile buffer size in bytes
  \end{itemize}
  \item inputs, a list of all the inputs that have been specified in the
  ``Step'' using this model.
  %
\end{itemize}
In the following an example is reported:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def initialize(self,runInfo,inputs):
 # Let's suppose we just need to initialize some variables
  self.sigma = 10.0
  self.rho   = 28.0
  # end function
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Method: \texttt{def createNewInput}}
\label{subsubsec:externalcreateNewInput}

The \textbf{createNewInput} method can be implemented by the user to create a
new input with the information coming from the RAVEN framework.
%
In this function, the user can retrieve the information coming from the RAVEN
framework, during the employment of a calculation flow, and use them to
construct a new input that is going to be transferred to the ``run'' method.
%
The new input created needs to be returned to RAVEN (i.e. ``return NewInput'').
%
RAVEN communicates, thorough a set of method attributes, all the information
that are generally needed to create a new input:
%myInput,samplerType,**Kwargs
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{inputs}, \xmlDesc{python list}, a list of all the inputs that
  have been defined in the ``Step'' using this model.
  \item \texttt{samplerType}, \xmlDesc{string}, the type of Sampler, if a
  sampling strategy is employed; will be None otherwise.
  \item \texttt{Kwargs}, \xmlDesc{dictionary}, a dictionary containing several
  pieces of information (that can change based on the ``Step'' type).
  %
  If a sampling strategy is employed, this dictionary contains another
  dictionary identified by the keyword ``SampledVars'', in which the variables
  perturbed by the sampler are reported.
\end{itemize}
\nb If the ``Step'' that is using this Model has as input(s) an object of main
class type ``Datas'' (see section \ref{datas}), the internal ``createNewInput''
method is going to convert it in a dictionary of values.
%

Here we present an example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def createNewInput(self,inputs,samplerType,**Kwargs):
  # in here the actual createNewInput of the
  # model is implemented
  if samplerType == ``MonteCarlo'':
    avariable = inputs[``something'']*inputs[``something2'']
  else:
    avariable = inputs[``something'']/inputs[``something2'']
  return avariable*Kwargs[``SampledVars''][``aSampledVar'']
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Method: \texttt{def run}}
\label{subsubsec:externalRun}
As stated previously, the only method that \emph{must} be present in an
External Module is the \textbf{run} function.
%
In this function, the user needs to implement the algorithm that RAVEN will
execute.
%
The \texttt{\textbf{run}} method is generally called after having inquired the
``createNewInput'' method (either the internal or the user-implemented one).
%
The only attribute this method is going to receive is a Python list of inputs
(the inputs coming from the \texttt{createNewInput} method).
%
If the user wants RAVEN to collect the results of this method, the outcomes of
interest need to be stored in ``self.''
%
\nb RAVEN is trying to collect the values of the variables listed only in the
\xmlNode{ExternalModel} XML block.
%

In the following an example is reported:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def run(self,Input):
  # in here the actual run of the
  # model is implemented
  input = Input[0]
  self.outcome = self.sigma*self.rho*input[``whatEver'']
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{PostProcessor}
\label{sec:models_postProcessor}
A Post-Processor (PP) can be considered as an action performed on a set of data
or other type of objects.
%
Most of the post-processors contained in RAVEN, employ a mathematical operation
on the data given as ``input''.
%
RAVEN supports several different types of PPs.

Currently, the following PPs are available in RAVEN:
\begin{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, user-defined
  identifier of this post-processor.
  %
  \nb As with other objects, this is the name that can be used to refer to this
  specific entity from other input XML blocks.
  \item \xmlAttr{subType}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, defines which of
  the post-processors needs to be used, choosing among the previously reported 
  types.
  %
  This choice conditions the subsequent required and/or optional
  \xmlNode{PostProcessor} sub nodes.
  %
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}

As already mentioned, all the types and meaning of the remaining sub-nodes
depend on the post-processor type specified in the attribute \xmlAttr{subType}.
%
In the following sections the specifications of each type are reported.

%%%%% PP BasicStatistics %%%%%%%
\paragraph{BasicStatistics}
\label{BasicStatistics}
The \textbf{BasicStatistics} post-processor is the container of the algorithms
to compute many of the most important statistical quantities.
%
\ppType{BasicStatistics post-processor}{BasicStatistics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{what}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
  %
  List of quantities to be computed.
  %
  Currently the quantities available are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{covariance matrix} -- covariance matrix
    \item \textbf{NormalizedSensitivity} -- matrix of normalized sensitivity
    coefficients
    \item \textbf{sensitivity} -- matrix of sensitivity coefficients
    \item \textbf{pearson} -- matrix of sensitivity coefficients
    \item \textbf{expectedValue} -- expected value or mean
    \item \textbf{sigma} -- standard deviation
    \item \textbf{variationCoefficient} -- coefficient of variation
    (sigma/expected value)
    \item \textbf{variance} --  variance
    \item \textbf{skewness} -- skewness
    \item \textbf{kurtois} -- kurtois
    \item \textbf{median} -- median
    \item \textbf{percentile} -- 95 percentile
    %
  \end{itemize}
  If all the quantities need to be computed, the user can input in the body of
  \xmlNode{what} the string ``all.''
  %
  \item \xmlNode{parameters}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, required field},
  lists the parameters on which the previous operations need to be applied
  (e.g., massFlow, Temperature)
  \item \xmlNode{methodsToRun}, \xmlDesc{comma separated string, optional
  field}, specifies the method names of an external Function that need to be run
  before computing any of the predefined quantities.
  %
  If this XML node is specified, the \xmlNode{Function} node must be present.
  %
  \default{None}
% Assembler Objects
  \item \textbf{Assembler Objects} These objects are either required or optional
  depending on the functionality of the Adaptive Sampler.
  %
  The objects must be listed with a rigorous syntax that, except for the xml
  node tag, is common among all the objects.
  %
  Each of these nodes must contain 2 attributes that are used to map those
  within the simulation framework:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{class}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, it is the main
    ``class'' the listed object is from;
    \item \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, it is the object
    identifier or sub-type.
    %
  \end{itemize}
  The \textbf{BasicStatistics} post-processor approach optionally accepts the
  following object type:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlNode{Function}, \xmlDesc{string, required field}, The body of
    this xml block needs to contain the name of an External Function defined
    within the \xmlNode{Functions} main block (see section \ref{sec:functions}).
    %
    This object needs to contain the methods listed in the node
    \xmlNode{methodsToRun}.

%%%%% PP ComparisonStatistics %%%%%%%

\label{ComparisonStatistics}
\TODO{To be finalized}

%%%%% PP SafestPoint %%%%%%%
\paragraph{SafestPoint}
\label{SafestPoint}
The \textbf{SafestPoint} post-processor provides the coordinates of the farthest
point from the limit surface that is given as an input.
%
The safest point coordinates are expected values of the coordinates of the
farthest points from the limit surface in the space of the ``controllable''
variables based on the probability distributions of the ``non-controllable''
variables.

The term ``controllable'' identifies those variables that are under control
during the system operation, while the ``non-controllable'' variables are
stochastic parameters affecting the system behaviour randomly.

The ``SafestPoint'' post-processor requires the set of points belonging to the
limit surface, which must be given as an input.
%
The probability distributions as ``Assembler Objects'' are required in the
``Distribution'' section for both ``controllable'' and ``non-controllable''
variables.

The sampling method used by the ``SafestPoint'' is a ``value'' or ``CDF'' grid.
%
At present only the ``equal'' grid type is available.

\ppType{Safest Point}{SafestPoint}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{Distribution}, \xmlDesc{Required}, represents the probability
  distributions of the ``controllable'' and ''non-controllable'' variables.
  %
  These are \textbf{Assembler Objects}, each of these nodes must contain 2
  attributes that are used to map those within the simulation framework:
	\begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{class}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, is the main
    ``class'' the listed object is from.
 		\item \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlDesc{required string attribute}, is the object
    identifier or sub-type.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \xmlNode{controllable} lists the controllable variables.
  %
  Each variable is associated with its name and the two items below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \xmlNode{distribution} names the probability distribution associated
    with the controllable variable.
    %
		\item \xmlNode{grid} specifies the \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlAttr{steps}, and
    tolerance of the sampling grid.
    %
	\end{itemize}
	\item \xmlNode{non-controllable} lists the non-controllable variables.
  %
  Each variable is associated with its name and the two items below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \xmlNode{distribution} names the probability distribution associated
    with the non-controllable variable.
    %
		\item \xmlNode{grid} specifies the \xmlAttr{type}, \xmlAttr{steps}, and
    tolerance of the sampling grid.

    identifier or sub-type.
    %
    For example, it can be ``ROM,'' ``External,'' etc.
    %

    boundaries.
    %
    This function must implement a method called
    \textit{\_\_residuumSign(self)}, that returns either -1 or 1, depending on
    the system conditions (see section \ref{sec:functions}).
