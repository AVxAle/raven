\label{sec:models}
In the RAVEN code a crucial entity is represented by a Model. A model is an object that employs a mathematical representation of a phenomenology, either physical or of other nature (e.g. statistical operators, etc.). From a practical point of view, it can be seen, as a ``black box'' that, given an input, returns an output. 
\\ In the RAVEN code, a strict  classification of the different models is present. As obviously, each ``class'' of models is represented by the definition reported above, but it can be further classified based on the peculiar functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Code}. This ``class'' is the representation of an external system code that employs an high fidelity physical model;
\item \textbf{Dummy}. The ``Dummy'' object is a model that acts as ``transfer'' tool. The only action it performs is transferring the the information in the input space (inputs) into the output space (outputs). For example, it can be used to check the effect of a Sampling strategy, since its outputs are the sampled parameters' values (input space) and a counter that keeps track of the number of times an evaluation has been requested; 
\item \textbf{ROM}. A ROM is a mathematical model of fast solution trained to predict a response of interest of a physical system. The ``training'' process is performed by “sampling” the response of a physical model with respect variation of its parameters subject to probabilistic behavior. The results (outcomes of the physical model) of those sampling are fed into the algorithm representing the ROM that tunes itself to replicate those results;
\item \textbf{ExternalModel}. This ``class'' is  this model allows to interface with an external python module

\item [Projector:] generic data manipulator
\item [PostProcessor:] an Action System. All the models here, take an input and perform an action
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ROM}

Description

Summary 
\begin{itemize}
\item name: name of the ROM model
\item subType: 'SciKitLearn'. Imports the libraries from scikitlearn
\item Features: input the variables set in the Samplers block separated by a comma
\item SKLtype: input a model from http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html (LinearRegression in the example)
\item Target: Input a set of variables inside the output space which the ROM has to be developed for. 
\item Parameters: From the SKLtype class are defined all the parameters required ($fit\_intercept$ and $normalize$ in the exemple) 
\end{itemize}

Example

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>

  <Features>***,***</Features>
  <SKLtype>linear_model|LinearRegression</SKLtype>

\subsection{External Model}
\label{subsec:models_externalModel}

Description

Summary

Example
As an example we use the external model shown in lorentzAttractor.py which, given the 3-dimensional initial coordinates (x0, y0, z0), calculate the trajectory of a Lorentz attractor in the time interval $[0.0,0.03]$ seconds.
We want to perform sampling of the 3-dimensional initial conditions of the attractor using classical Monte-Carlo sampling.
The user is required to specify:
\begin{itemize}
\item the initialize function: def initialize(self,runInfoDict,inputFiles)
\item the function which create a new input: def createNewInput(self,myInput,samplerType,**Kwargs)
\item the function which perform the actual calculation: def run(self,Input)
\end{itemize}

\begin{python}
def initialize(self,runInfoDict,inputFiles):
  self.SampledVars = None
  self.sigma = 10.0
  self.rho   = 28.0
  self.beta  = 8.0/3.0
  return

def createNewInput(self,myInput,samplerType,**Kwargs):
  return Kwargs['SampledVars']

def run(self,Input):
   ...
\end{python}


\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<Models>
    <ExternalModel name='PythonModule' subType='' ModuleToLoad='externalModel/lorentzAttractor'>  
       <variable type='float'>sigma</variable>
       <variable type='float'>rho</variable>
       <variable type='float'>beta</variable>
       <variable type='numpy.ndarray'>x</variable>
       <variable type='numpy.ndarray'>y</variable>
       <variable type='numpy.ndarray'>z</variable>
       <variable type='numpy.ndarray'>time</variable>
       <variable type='float'>x0</variable>
       <variable type='float'>y0</variable>
       <variable type='float'>z0</variable>
    </ExternalModel>
