RAVEN

RAVEN is a generic software framework designed to perform parametric and stochastic analysis 
based on the response of complex system codes. The initial development was aimed to provide 
dynamic risk analysis capabilities to the Thermo-Hydraulic code RELAP-7, currently under 
development at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).
Although the initial goal has been fully accomplished, RAVEN is now a multi-purpose probabilistic 
and uncertainty quantification platform, capable to communicate with any system code. This agnosticism 
includes providing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs allow RAVEN to interact with 
any code as long as all the parameters that need to be perturbed are accessible by inputs files or via 
python interfaces. RAVEN is capable of investigating the system response, and investigating the input 
space using Monte Carlo, Grid, or Latin Hyper Cube sampling schemes, but its strength is focused 
toward system feature discovery, such as limit surfaces, separating regions of the input space leading 
to system failure,  using dynamic supervised learning techniques. The development of RAVEN has started 
in 2012, when, within the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program, the need to 
provide a modern risk evaluation framework became stronger. RAVEN principal assignment is to provide the 
necessary software and algorithms in order to employ the concept developed by the Risk Informed Safety 
Margin Characterization (RISMC) program. RISMC is one of the pathways defined within the Light Water
Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program. In the RISMC approach, the goal is not just the individuation of
the frequency of an event potentially leading to a system failure, but the closeness (or not) to key
safety-related events. Hence, the approach is interested in identifying and increasing the safety margins
related to those events. A safety margin is a numerical value quantifying the probability that a safety
metric (e.g. for an important process such as peak pressure in a pipe) is exceeded under certain conditions. 
The initial development of RAVEN has been focused on providing dynamic risk assessment capability to 
RELAP-7, currently under development at the INL and, likely, future replacement of the RELAP5-3D code. 
Most the capabilities that have been implemented having RELAP-7 as principal focus are easily deployable 
for other system codes.
