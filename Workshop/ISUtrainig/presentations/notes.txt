Things to talk about:

Wiki: https://hpcsc.inel.gov/moose/wiki/RAVEN

Ticket system: https://hpcsc.inel.gov/moose/report and https://hpcsc.inel.gov/moose/newticket  Set component as raven, email one of developers.

Unix hint:

whatever 2>&1 | tee output.txt

will save the output of whatever to the file output.txt as well as
echo it to the screen.

Compiling:
1. Get moose running (follow instructions at http://mooseframework.org/getting-started/ )
 a. Get dependencies
 b. compile libmesh
 c. compile moose test
 d. run tests
2. Either install framework dependencies or run compile script.
 a. linux can grab them from repositories.
 b. There is a package for OSX.
 c. Otherwise you can run raven_libs_script.sh
3. Compile crow
4. Run tests.

PBS:
See the raven/framework/README.txt for many more details.
Can run with either mpi (openmpi) or pbsdsh.

Can also create a new method of running.  Need to use a mode of
CustomMode and specify the class and file that contains a class that
overrides SimulationMode

<CustomMode file="./mode_test/new_mode.py" class="NewMode">a_new_mode</CustomMode>

The custom class should override modifySimulation, and can also
override runOverride, doOverrideRun and XMLread.

Take a look at raven/inputs/mpi_driver_test/test_mpiqsub.xml and
raven/inputs/mpi_driver_test/test_pbs.xml  for examples.

Take a look at raven/framework/Simulation.py
